Hi, every one

My name is Trang, My full name is NguyenXuanTrang.

I'm 34 years old.

I was born and raised in a rural village in ThaiBinh province.

My phone number is 03540688885.

I like reading stories, watching movies, reading books and playing games.

Today, My talk will be on the topic of weather.

Are you ready, lets begin.

I am living and working in HaNoi city.

I have bean living here since i went to university, about 15 years.

Hanoi is located in the Northern of Vietnam.

Thereforce, there are four distinkt seasons here: Spring, Summer, Autum and Winter.

I think Summer is the season with the most exciting things.

Currently, as I am making this video, it is September and still Summer.

Thereforce, today we will talk about Summer.

The dominant weather of Summer is hot and rainy.

Some days are very hot, reaching over 35°C.

On these days, I usually stay in an air-conditional environment /ɪnˈvaɪ.rən.mənt/ and go outside little as possible /ˈpɑːsəbl/.

When going outside, I often have to wear a sun-protective /prəˈtek.tɪv/ jaket.

The hot weather combined with the polluted /pəˈluːtid/ air of Hanoi creates a very unpleasant feeling.

Occasionally, there are also big storms in the Summer.

Two days ago, Northern /ˈnɔrðərn/ VN experienced a very strong storm.

It was the strongest storm I have seen.

Many trees and buildings were destroyed /dɪsˈtrɔɪd/, and several dozen people lost their lives.

Curretly /ˈkʌrəntli/, it is still ranning due to aftermath of the storm.

Many areas were flooded /ˈflʌd.ɪd/, and a bridge was broken.

Besides that, summer also has many exciting /ɪkˈsaɪ.t̬ɪŋ/ things.

First, in Summer, the days are longer night, so you will have a lot of time.

In the morning, the Sun rises early, so you can go excercise and watch runsice.

You can go on the beach vacation to escape the heat.

On cooler days, you can go fishing or play sports.

YOu can also enjoy a lot of tropical fruits.

I like eating lychee /ˈliːʧi/, longan /ˈlɔŋɡən/, sapodilla /sæpəˈdɪlə/, mango /ˈmæŋɡoʊ/, and custard /ˈkʌstərd/ apple.

If you are a student or a teacher, you also have a fairly long vacation.

In summary, summer is often a season with quite a few experiences. It is a part of life.
