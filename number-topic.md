Hi every one, Welcome to my topic of Numbers.

Let's go.

My name is Trang and my full name is Nguyen Xuan Trang.

I'm 34 years old. I am from Thai Binh.

I am living in Hanoi city now.

Hanoi covers an area of about 3500 km2 with approximately 8.4 million people.

Therefore, it's quite crowded.

I have been in Hanoi for about 15 years.

In 2009, i was admitted to Hanoi University of Science and Technology.

I studied in Department Applied Mathematics and Informatics.

In 2014, i graduated and started working.

In 2000, i married my wife.

It's quite an intersting love story.

In 2018, While brosing Facebook, i saw her profile.

I sent a friend request, and she accepted it.

On our first meeting, we went to mediate at a temple.

After that, we went out for meals, watched movies and visited parks together many times.

From then on, we fell in love witch each other.

In 2000, we welcomed our first son.

We call the boy Gao at home.

When he was born, he weighed only 2.6 kg.

Now, he is four years old, 1 metter tall, and weighs 12 kg.
